### Abstract

Provide a 3-5 sentence summary of your work on the primary task. Indicate what input data was used, what method was used for binary class predictions, what method was used for multiclass predictions, and what estimated accuracies were achieved.

> *Header and paragraph content was scraped from the raw webpages and processed into term frequencies of word tokens. For binary classification, a four-layer neural network yielded an estimated 81.3% accuracy; for multiclass classification, a support vector machine gave 78% accuracy.*

### Preprocessing

In one paragraph lay out your preprocessing pipeline. No need to provide exact step-by-step detail; just give an overview of the main components:

-   what text content was extracted from HTML

-   how text was cleaned

-   how cleaned text was represented quantitatively

Our group extracted all paragraph and header content from the HTML pages in the `claims_raw` data file, and subsequently removed all punctuation, numbers, symbols (including url and email instances) in order to make the classification process easier. Lastly, all characters were coerded to be lowercase. With the resulting text data, we applied the `layer_text_vectorization` function of the `keras` package in order to map strings to their respective token indices. Within this function we specified that the maximum amount of tokens to be used would be 10000 and set the sequence length of the output for this preprocessing layer to be padded or shortened to 100 tokens, due to the fact that the model will require a set input length. We then used `adapt` on the text vectorization layer which matches its internal layers to the training data. 

### Methods

Describe your final predictive models. Include one paragraph with details on the binary classification approach, and one on the multiclass approach. Include for each:

-   what ML/statistical method was used

-   model specification and hyperparameter selection

-   training method

**Binary**: We used a recurrent neural network (RNN) for the binary classification of the fraud claims. Our group decided that the nature of our task is conducive towards a model that retains information well and use this past knowledge to inform decisions, and RNN's excel at this task due to their "recurrent" neurons that loop back to themselves. 

### Results

Indicate the predictive accuracy of the binary classifications and the multiclass classifications. Provide a table for each, and report sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.[^1]
